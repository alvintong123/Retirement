# Retirement 
## Analysis 
The purpose of this analysis was to figure out the number of employees that would retire very soon based on birth date and when they started working as well as knowing what positions they could potentially be leaving vacant. We achieved this by first filtering out employees who were born from 1952 to 1955 which would put them at roughly retirement age while also displaying their current position within the company. This way we can get a rough estimate on when people will be retiring to fill those vacancies while also preparing for those spots to be vacant to ensure we can still function at normal capacity. In addition we created a mentorship eligibility list to see whcih employees will qualify to be in a mentorship program to hopefully train new people. 
## Results 
* In the near future we will lose a large number of Senior Engineer and Senior Staff positions since they contain a lot of eployees with 25916 and 24926  respectively 
* We will lose two managers out of the 9 we currently have which is not as detrimental when compared to other groups
* There are no managers eligible to be in the mentorship program which means we will likely have to find new hires for the position or train an existing employee to be a Manager 
* We do not have enough people in the mentorship program to sustain
## Summary 
According to the data we will need 25916 Senior Engineers, 24926 Senior Staff, 9285 Engineers, 7636 Staff, 3603 Technique Leaders, 1090 Assistant Engineers, and 2 Managers to completely fill the potential vacant spot due to the siler tsunami. In terms of ready mentors we are lacking in that department as we only have a couple hundred eligible employees to be in that service. This is not as bad for other positions, but it detrimental to positions like Senior Engineers and Senior Staff which have tens of thousands of potential retirees. The Manager position will be the least affected as that position will only lose about 22% of current employees while every other postion will lose about 30% of their workforce.
