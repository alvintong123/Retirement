# Retirement 
## Analysis 
The purpose of this analysis was to figure out the number of employees that would retire very soon based on birth date and when they started working as well as knowing what positions they could potentially be leaving vacant. We achieved this by first filtering out employees who were born from 1952 to 1955 which would put them at roughly retirement age while also displaying their current position within the company. This way we can get a rough estimate on when people will be retiring to fill those vacancies while also preparing for those spots to be vacant to ensure we can still function at normal capacity. In addition we created a mentorship eligibility list to see whcih employees will qualify to be in a mentorship program to hopefully train new people.
